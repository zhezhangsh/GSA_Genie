For each gene set, over-representation GSA tests <b><i><u>n1/N1 >> n0/N0</u></i></b>; where <b><i>N1</i></b> is the size of user-specified gene list which is a subset of the background; <b><i>n1</i></b> is the number of the genes within both of the user's gene list and gene set; <b><i>N0</i></b> is all genes of the background other than those in the user's list; and <b><i>n0</i></b> is the number of genes within the gene set, but not within the user's list.
--- The gene sets to be tested could include the whole table from <b>Step 1</b>, or the ones highlighted by the user.
--- There are 3 options of background genes: provided by the user from <b>Step 2</b> when available; all known genes of the species; or all genes in the whole collection. The first option is usually preferred. 
--- There are 3 options of statistical methods to test <b><i><u>n1/N1 >> n0/N0</u></i></b>
