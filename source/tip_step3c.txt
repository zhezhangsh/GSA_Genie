For each gene set, GSA of gene-level statistics tests <b><i><u>V1 != V0</u></i></b>; where <b><i>V1</i></b> and <b><i>V0</i></b> are the mean or distribution of the statistics respectively from genes within the gene set and all the other genes.
--- The gene sets to be tested could include all rows in the table from <b>Step 1</b>, or the selected ones if they are highlighted at step 1 by users.
--- Different GSA methods are applicable to different types of statistics. GSA Genie will make a best guess what kind of variable the test statistics is:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. P-like statistics have values from 0 to 1. GSA Genie will replace 0 with the minimal non-zero p value of any gene before analysis, since p value = 0 is theoretically impossible.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. T-like statistics have values from -Inf to +Inf. While not required, t-like statistics preferrably have most values around 0 and similar numbers of positive and negative values. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. F-like statistics have all positive values usually having a skewed bell-shaped distribution. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If GSA Genie or user cannot decide the gene-level statistics is one of the above, only distribution-free methods, such as Wilcoxon rank sum test, or methods based on gene sampling can be available. 
--- The <b>piano</b> package allows to add direction to non-negative statistics. For example, users might want to distingush p values corresponding to positive vs. negative fold changes. The direction information need to be obtained from an extra column of the uploaded table.
--- Users also have the option to convert the gene-level statisitcs by fitting it to a normal distribtion, log-transforming it or ranking it from low to high. If a P-like or F-like statistics is diretioned and log-transformed or fitted to normal distribution, it will be treated as a T-like statistics. Ranking gene will have the same effect on any kinds of statistics.
--- Most of the GSA methods available are implemented by the R <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632109', target='_blank'><b>piano</b></a> package. GSA Genie added two more methods: <b>Student's t</b> and <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> tests. Methods such as <b>GSEA</b> and <b>Reporter features</b> take a few seconds or longer time to test each gene set, making them not suitable for online GSA of a large collection of gene sets. So there is a limit of number of gene sets for some of the methods to be run online. Instead, users can download the whole a collection of gene sets and test them on their own systems. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a href='http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp', target='_blank'><b>GSEA</b></a> is a popular, but slow GSA method; applicable only to T-like statistics.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1183189', target='_blank'><b>PAGE</b></a> is a musch faster alternative of GSEA.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannâ€“Whitney_U_test', target='_blank'><b>Wilcoxon rank sum test</b></a> is non-parametric method appliable to any types of statistics.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher's_method', target='_blank'><b>Fisher's combined p</b></a> is a meta-analysis method only applicable to P-like statistics. <b>Stouffer's</b> is a similar method that converts p value to z score first and <b>Reporter features</b> is the same as Stouffer's method with adjustment to background distribution and much slower. <b>Tail strength</b> is another method for P-like statistics that weights p values according to their ranking. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mean, Median, Sum, and Maxmean</b> are methods comparing summary statistics via re-sampling genes.
