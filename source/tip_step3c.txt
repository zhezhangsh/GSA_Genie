For each gene set, GSA of gene-level statistics tests <b><i><u>V1 != V0</u></i></b>; where <b><i>V1</i></b> and <b><i>V0</i></b> are vectors of the statistics of genes within the gene set and all the other genes.
--- The gene sets to be tested could include all rows in the table from <b>Step 1</b>, or the ones highlighted by the user.
--- Different GSA methods are applicable to different types of gene-level statistics. GSA Genie will make a best guess what kind of variable the test statistics is:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. P-like statistics have values from 0 to 1. GSA Genie will replace 0 with the minimal non-zero p value of any gene for the analysis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. T-like statistics have values from -Inf to +Inf. Theoretically, they should a bell-shaped distribution around 0. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. F-like statistics have all positive values usually having a skewed bell-shaped distribution. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If GSA Genie or user cannot decide the gene-level statistics is one of the above, only non-parametric methods, such as Wilcoxon rank sum test, or methods based on gene sampling can be used. 
--- The <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632109', target='_blank'><b>piano</b></a> package allows to add direction to non-directional statistics like p value, if users want to distingush positive and negative mean difference in case of 2-group comparison. The direction information will be defined by an extra column of the uploaded table.
--- Users also have the option to convert the gene-level statisitcs by fitting it to a normal distribtion, log-transforming it or ranking it. If a P-like or F-like statistics is diretioned and logged or fitted to normal, it will be treated as a T-like statistics. Ranking gene will have the same effect on all types of statistics.
--- Most of the GSA methods available are implemented by the R <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632109', target='_blank'><b>piano</b></a> package. GSA Genie added two more methods: <b>Student's t</b> and <b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</b> tests. Methods such as <b>GSEA</b> and <b>Reporter features</b> take too much time to be run online on a large number of gene sets, so users need to select a small number of gene sets to use these methods. Otherwise, users can download the whole collection of gene sets and test them on their own system. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a href='http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp', target='_blank'><b>GSEA</b></a> is a popular, but slow GSA method; applicable only to T-like statistics.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1183189', target='_blank'><b>PAGE</b></a> is a musch faster alternative of GSEA.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannâ€“Whitney_U_test', target='_blank'><b>Wilcoxon rank sum test</b></a> is non-parametric method appliable to any types of statistics.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Methods only applicable to P-like statistics: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher's_method', target='_blank'><b>Fisher's combined p</b></a> performs meta-analysis on the p values; <b>Stouffer's</b> converts p values to z scores first and run meta-analysis; <b>Reporter features</b> is the same as Stouffer's with adjustment to background distribution and slower; and <b>Tail strength</b> weights p values according to their ranking.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mean, Median, and Sum</b> are applicable to all types of statistics and compare summary statistics via re-sampling genes.
